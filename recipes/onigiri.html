    <p>Recipe of the snack that bought tears to Chihiro's eyes</p>
    <em><p>“They don't remember being human, so look hard. It's up to you to remember which ones they are.”</p></em>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>6 mini sheets of roasted seaweed (aka "nori")</li>
        <li>3/4 cup shredded cooked salmon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice</li>
        <li>a triangle shaped cookie cutter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the nori sheets</li>
        <li>Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until it's well coated</li>
        <li>Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie cutter and push some of it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely lined with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li> Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber spatula</li>
        <li>Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around just a little,</li>
        <li>Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra rice if you need more to cover up the salmon.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any loose ends around the outside of the onigiri.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients</li>
        <li>Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, place them on a baking sheet and chill until ready to serve</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of each onigiri. </li>
    </ol>
